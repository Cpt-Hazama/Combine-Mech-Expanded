# Combine-Mech-Expanded
An unofficial revamp/update to Sakarias88's Combine Mech mod. Most of this mod is untouched to preserve the original functionality. All I have done is renamed some stuff, fixed some bugs, revamped some features to make them better, and the addition of new mechs/options. I played with this mod a lot when it first came out before GMod 13, so fixing it up and re-releasing it for everyone to enjoy again means a lot. If Sakarias wants me to remove this I will, though I would hope that he wouldn't as all of his mods are GMod classics and even to this day hold up as some of the best!

## Changes

* Fixed all errors in the original mod
* Improved some code in some areas
* Improved first/third person view (positioning / refresh rate)
* Mechs now apply the screen shake effect to nearby players when they walk
* Fixed the turret sounds always playing in the left audio channel
* Lowered the crouch height to make the mech crouch more than before
* Added convars for changing the max health/shield of the mechs, max hover height, enabling weapons during hovering, as well as a convar to disable these modifiers all together
* Mech HUD colors are now linked to / affected by your physgun color
* Added VJ Base support, VJ NPCs can now target you inside of the Mechs
